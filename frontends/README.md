The front-end of the P4 compiler is responsible for transforming the high-level P4 source code into an Intermediate Representation (IR) while ensuring that the code is valid and optimized. This stage is entirely architecture-independent and consists of several critical passes:

- **Program Parsing:** Converts the P4 source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Validation:** Checks the program against P4 language rules and constraints to ensure it is valid.
- **Name Resolution:** Resolves all identifiers, such as variables and functions, to their declarations.
- **Type Checking/Inference:** Uses the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm to ensure that all types are correctly assigned and compatible.
- **Making Semantics Explicit:** Ensures the program's semantics, such as the order of side effects, are clearly defined and explicit.
## Optimization Tasks
The front-end also performs some optimization-related tasks, including:
- **Inlining:** Replaces function calls with the function body to reduce overhead.
- **Compile-Time Evaluation and Specialization:** Evaluates expressions and specializes code at compile time for efficiency.
- **Conversion to P4 Source:** Converts the AST back to P4 source code if needed.
- **Deparser Inference (for P4_14 programs):** Automatically infers deparser logic for P4_14 programs.

After completing these passes, the front-end generates the control-plane API, which is essential for the interaction between the control plane and the data plane.
