# Midend
<!--!
\endinternal
-->
The [`midend` directory](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/tree/main/midend) contains passes which may be useful for implementing various mid-ends.
These are linked as part of the front-end library.
These passes are not used in the front-end, but are still largely architecture-independent.
